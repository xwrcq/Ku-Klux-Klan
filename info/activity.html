              The Ku Klux Klan (KKK) is a white supremacist hate group that has been active in the United States since
              its founding in the post-Civil War era. The KKK has gone through several iterations, each characterized by
              its own methods of terror, targets, and social influence.</p>

              <p class="main__description">
                Founding and Purpose: Founded in 1865 in Pulaski, Tennessee, by Confederate veterans, the Klan sought to
                undermine Reconstruction efforts and maintain white supremacy.
              </p>
              <p class="main__description">
                Activities: The group used violence and intimidation against Black people and their allies, including
                lynchings, beatings, and arson.
              </p>
              <p class="main__description">
                Suppression: The federal government enacted the Enforcement Acts, including the Ku Klux Klan Act of
                1871, which led to the Klan's decline through legal action and military intervention.

            <div class="main__description-container">
              <p class="main__description">
                Rebirth and Growth: Revived in 1915 in Atlanta, Georgia, partly inspired by the film "The Birth of a
                Nation," which glorified the first Klan. It expanded nationally, peaking in the 1920s with millions of
                members.
              <p class="main__description">
                Ideology and Targets: This iteration broadened its focus to include not only Black people but also Jews,
                Catholics, immigrants, and other minority groups. It promoted "100% Americanism" and nativism.
              </p>
              <p class="main__description">
                Influence and Decline: The second Klan had significant political influence, particularly in the Midwest
                and South, but internal scandals and financial troubles led to its decline by the 1940s.

              <p class="main__description">
                Civil Rights Era: The Klan re-emerged in response to the Civil Rights Movement, engaging in violent acts
                such as bombings, murders, and assaults to oppose desegregation and civil rights for Black Americans.
              <p class="main__description">
                Modern Era: Today, the Klan is fragmented into various small, independent groups. While its membership
                and influence are much reduced, it remains active in promoting white supremacist ideology.

            <div class="main__description-container">
              <p class="main__description">
                Tactics: Contemporary Klan groups continue to use traditional methods of intimidation, including cross
                burnings, rallies, and distribution of propaganda. They also use social media and the internet to
                recruit and spread their message.
              <p class="main__description">
                Targets: The Klan still targets Black Americans, Jews, immigrants, LGBTQ+ individuals, and other
                minority groups.
              </p>
              <p class="main__description">
                Law Enforcement and Legal Actions: The FBI and other law enforcement agencies monitor Klan activities
                closely. Various Klan groups have been subjected to lawsuits and legal actions that have further
                diminished their capacity.
              </p>
              <p class="main__description">
                Fragmentation and Alliances: The modern Klan is not a monolithic organization but a collection of small,
                often competing groups. They sometimes form alliances with other white supremacist and far-right
                extremist groups.

                Hate Crimes and Domestic Terrorism: The Klan's activities are considered a significant source of hate

              </p>
              <p class="main__description">
                Online Presence: Modern Klan groups heavily utilize the internet for recruitment and spreading
                propaganda. Social media platforms, forums, and encrypted messaging apps serve as tools for
                communication and dissemination of white supremacist ideology.
              </p>
              <p class="main__description">
                Public Demonstrations: While the size and frequency of public rallies have decreased, Klan groups still
                organize events such as marches, cross burnings, and protests. These events often draw counter-protests
                and significant media attention.
              </p>
              <p class="main__description">
                Propaganda Distribution: Flyers, leaflets, and other forms of printed propaganda are distributed in
                neighborhoods, particularly in areas experiencing demographic changes or racial tension. These materials
                often include racist, anti-Semitic, and xenophobic messages.</p>
              <p class="main__description">
                Violent Acts: Acts of violence, including assaults, arson, and threats against minority communities,
                continue to be perpetrated by Klan members. These hate crimes are intended to instill fear and maintain
                white supremacy.
              </p>
              <p class="main__description">
                Alliances with Other Extremist Groups: Klan factions sometimes collaborate with other white supremacist
                and far-right extremist groups, such as neo-Nazis and militia movements. These alliances can enhance
                their capabilities and extend their reach.</p>
              <p class="main__description">
                Contributions to Racial Tension: Klan activities contribute to racial tension and violence in
                communities across the U.S. Their actions exacerbate divisions and create an atmosphere of fear and
                hostility.</p>
              <p class="main__description">
                Domestic Terrorism: The Klan is recognized as a source of domestic terrorism, responsible for numerous
                hate crimes and acts of terror. This includes bombings, arson, and physical assaults targeting minority
                communities.</p>
